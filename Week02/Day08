# Two Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

- Each input has **exactly one solution**
- You may **not use the same element twice**
- The answer can be returned in **any order**

---

## Example

**Input**
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9


**Output**
[0,1]


**Explanation**

`nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`

---

## Approach

We use a **HashMap** to store numbers we have already seen along with their indices.

### Key Idea
- For every number `num`, compute its complement:  
  `complement = target - num`
- If the complement exists in the map, we have found the answer
- Otherwise, store the current number with its index

This allows solving the problem in a **single pass**.

### Steps
1. Initialize a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>`  
2. Iterate through the array
3. For each element:
   - Check if `(target - nums[i])` exists in the map
   - If yes, return the indices
   - Else, store `nums[i]` with index `i`
